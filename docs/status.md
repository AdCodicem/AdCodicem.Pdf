# Project status

A living file, updated **at the end of every session**. It describes the real state, not intentions.
Keep it short: summarise the journal once it passes a dozen entries — the detailed history is in git, not
here.

## At a glance

- **Current milestone**: M1 — Object model and tolerant reading (`docs/milestones/M1.md`), slices 1 to 8 written
- **Last milestone closed**: M0 — Repository foundations
- **Builds**: yes — **Tests**: 102, all green — **CI**: green
- **Branch**: `claude/nuget-pdf-html-dotnet-msyz8z`

### Current measurements (BenchmarkDotNet, ShortRun)

| Operation | Document | Time | Allocated |
|---|---|---|---|
| Indexing | synthetic, 1000 pages, ~4 MB | 229 µs | 393 KB |
| Indexing, then reading every page | synthetic, 1000 pages, ~4 MB | 6.2 ms | 5.9 MB |
| Indexing and walking the page tree | real ReportLab document, 1000 pages | — | 2.4 MB |

The gap between the first two rows is the library's promise: opening a document does not read its content.
Indexing costs roughly 200 bytes per object, whatever the objects weigh. The third row is asserted as a
budget in CI (`CorpusReadingTests`), so an allocation regression fails the build.

## Next concrete step

Close M1: fuzz the lexer and parser, seeded with the damaged corpus (T08). Then M2 — writing and
round-trip fidelity, whose acceptance is that every corpus document survives open → save → reopen and is
still accepted by an independent tool.

## Journal

### 2026-09-13 — The corpus of real documents
- 19 documents built by four real producers — Chromium (Skia backend), LibreOffice, ReportLab, qpdf —
  covering invoices, a multi-page report, a contract, an interactive form, a scanned page, a PDF/A-2b
  export, a linearised file, an object-stream rewrite, an AES-256 encrypted file, a 1000-page document,
  and five copies damaged on purpose. 2.7 MB, committed, reproducible via `tests/corpus/build`.
- Expectations in the manifest are established by an **independent tool**, never by our own reader,
  including what qpdf can still recover from each damaged file.
- `CorpusReadingTests` turns the M1 acceptance conditions into 45 executable tests: every document opens
  as described, damaged ones report their damage, well-formed ones produce no repair and no warning, page
  counts match across all four producers, opening never reads content, and indexing the 1000-page document
  holds inside a measured 4 MB budget.
- Three real defects in the expectations surfaced immediately, and were worth the exercise: a wrong
  `/Length` is only noticed when the stream is actually read (the lazy reader working as designed, so the
  test now reads everything before judging), shifting every offset breaks `startxref` itself so the whole
  index is rebuilt rather than relocated object by object, and a process-wide allocation counter is
  meaningless in a parallel suite.

### 2026-09-13 — English throughout, and corpus-based acceptance
- All project documentation rewritten in English (D19). The convention is now: everything in English, code
  and documentation alike.
- Every milestone now carries **acceptance conditions** expressed against real documents, and `docs/corpus.md`
  defines where those documents come from, how they are catalogued and what closing a milestone requires
  (D18, invariant 10).
- The corpus can be produced in-container and committed: Chromium's Skia backend, LibreOffice, and Python
  producers from pypi give genuinely different cross-reference shapes, font handling and object stream use.

### 2026-09-13 — M1, slices 1 to 7
- COS object model, tolerant lexer and parser, decoding filters, all four index shapes (classic table,
  cross-reference stream, object stream, `/Prev` chain, hybrid files), lazy resolution with a bounded
  cache, repair by scanning, structured diagnostics.
- Hardening: every allocation a file could dictate is bounded (a stream length clamped to the real file
  size, an object stream's object count clamped to what its header could hold), and cycles — references,
  `/Prev`, an object stream containing itself — all terminate.
- A file with no usable object is refused with a typed exception rather than opened empty.
- 73 tests, including a class devoted to hostile input with a per-test time budget.
- Tests build their PDFs byte by byte with exact offsets, then damage them on purpose: no network
  dependency and no binaries in the repository. Real documents come next, as the corpus.
- Tooling: the .NET 10 SDK installs from the Ubuntu archive; `dotnet test` now requires
  Microsoft.Testing.Platform (opted into via `global.json`) and the `--solution` form.

### 2026-09-12 — Framing and foundations
- Scope settled in two steps: HTML → PDF generation first, then extended to full manipulation of existing
  documents. Nineteen decisions recorded in `docs/decisions.md`.
- Documentation frame established: `CLAUDE.md` (session frame), `architecture.md`, `decisions.md`,
  `roadmap.md` (M0 to M12), `corpus.md`, `milestones/` (per-milestone specification), this file.
- Solution skeleton: core, HTML engine, ASP.NET Core integration, tests, benchmarks; `net10.0` target,
  central package management.
- Environment: the .NET SDK is absent from web sessions and Microsoft's servers are blocked by the network
  policy. Worked around through the Ubuntu archive (`dotnet-sdk-10.0`), automated by the `SessionStart` hook.

## Debt and open points

| # | Subject | Decision expected |
|---|---------|-------------------|
| T01 | `TreatWarningsAsErrors` is off while the foundations settle | Turn on when M2 closes |
| T02 | XML documentation (`CS1591`) is not enforced on the public API | Enforce when the public API freezes (M5.6) |
| ~~T03~~ | ~~The real-document corpus is not built yet~~ | Done: `tests/corpus`, 19 documents, four producers |
| T04 | An OFL font set must be embedded for default rendering | During M4 |
| T05 | A public API test (a baseline of exported signatures) | Put in place at the start of M5 |
| T06 | `PdfString.ToText` reads Latin-1 rather than full PDFDocEncoding (the 32 positions 0x80-0x9F differ) | Before the first public release |
| T07 | The object cache evicts FIFO rather than LRU; names are interned through an intermediate string | M11, with measurements |
| T08 | Fuzzing of the lexer and parser is not set up | Closing M1 |
| T09 | A memory budget is now enforced in CI; a throughput budget is not | Throughput budget in M11 |
